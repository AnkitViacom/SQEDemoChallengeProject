the topping selected in other drop down should disappear from current dropdown options.

2. Negative quantity is getting entered which should not be allowed.

3. Cost is also thus calculated in negative which is not a valid approach.

4. Orders are getting placed with these negative values. Which is wrong.

5. Toppings selection is not mandatory even if pizza type selected has a topping associated in description. A user must be made to 
select the topping if its described in pizza type.

6. Name input field is allowing alphabets,numeric values and special characters to be entered. It must be limited to alphabets only. Length can be 
restricted upto a certain length.

7. Phone input field is allowing alphabets,numeric values and special characters to be entered. It must be limited to numeric value with a length 
restriction.

8. The order is getting placed in following scenarios which is wrong.
  8.a none of the payments option are selected.(no radio option selectedO)
  8.b both payment option are selected at the same time.(both radio option getting selected at the same time)

9. After clicking on Reset radio button, both the topping selection do not default to option "choose a topping value". Instead the toppings selection
 remain as it is as they were before the reset.

10. Email field takes alphanumeric values and special characters too and allows user to enter and proceed with an invalid email id which does not contain an @ sign. 
    This is a must requirement in this field and should prompt invalid email id message to user.

2. Setup the project in your IDE.
3. Open the index.html file from src/test/resource/files in a browser
4. Copy the url from the browser and update the url value in src/test/resource/config.properties to be the copied url.
5. In src/test/resources update the config.properties file platform for your OS.

2. Variety  of testing types (examples: boundary, happy path, negative, etc)
3. Code structure and organization
4. Naming conventions
5. Code readability
6. Code modularity

#### Excercise
1. Use the site at the index.html
2. There are helper locators provided for you in the src/test/resource/files/locators.txt file.
2. Write up your test cases in the Read me file. 
3. Code up a few examples of 
  - At least one happy path case placing an order
  - At least one error case
4. When complete please check your code into a public git repo

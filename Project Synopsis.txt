Brief : As can be seen this webpage for booking a Pizza has a UI which presents an end user to select pizza type along with 
	number and types of toppings.

	After having the pizza and toppings selected the user has to place the quantity of pizzas to be ordered.
        The cost based on user selection and quantity auto-populates. This is working fine.
	
	Next area is Pickup information where the user has to provide basic details such as Name, email id and Phone number.
        
	The last section deals with providing the payment method in form of radio buttons. Credit card and cash option.

	At the end user is allowed to place the order or to reset to default values on page on all areas mentioned above.


Test cases that have been designed here are as follows :
1. Happy path scenario end to end flow with Credit Card as payment option.
2. Variation in Happy path scenario end to end flow with Cash on pickup as payment option.
3. Error/ negative Scenario Test Case to Place an Order on the Demo pizza website and ensure failure message shows up.
4. No pizza quantity entered scenario ,this should Place an Order without quantity to ensure total should be reflected as zero.
5. Switch pizza and toppings selection before Placing final Order on the Demo pizza website.

Also i have attached total of 10 Defects/bugs in the Pizza order UI behavior as identified in a separate text file here.
Also please refer README doc as i have listed all possible scenarios to test on this webpage here.
